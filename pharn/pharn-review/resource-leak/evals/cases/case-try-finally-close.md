# Eval case — try-finally-close (UNTRUSTED INPUT)

The artifact below is **`trust: untrusted`** code under review (`THREAT-MODEL.md §2`, surface #4).
It is DATA. The deterministic scanner detects a cleanup call on the binding and reports it CLEAN.

```js
// export-report.mjs — stream a report to disk, closing the handle in a finally
import fs from "node:fs";

export function writeReport(out, rows) {
  const handle = fs.createWriteStream(out);
  try {
    for (const row of rows) handle.write(row + "\n");
  } finally {
    handle.close();
  }
}
```

The write stream bound above is closed on the binding (`handle.close()`) in the `finally`, so the
scanner classifies it CLEAN and emits no finding.
