// pharn/floor/check-spec-approved.mjs — the deterministic APPROVED-INPUT GATE for /pharn-plan.
//
// Floor primitives (ARCHITECTURE §2): #3 (enum) for `state === "Approved"`, and — REUSED, not
// re-implemented — #3 (presence/enum) + #2 (content-hash) via check-spec.mjs for shape, the state
// enum, spec_id, and the Approved-pin (spec_content_hash == sha256(body)). It is the floor reduction of
// the §6 plan-stage PRECONDITION: a PLAN may be produced only from an Approved, un-drifted SPEC
// (fix #4). /pharn-plan is the FIRST downstream consumer that ENFORCES /pharn-spec's pin, so the pin is
// NOT decorative. Cited, not restated (P4).
//
// WHY a wrapper over check-spec.mjs (the reuse): check-spec.mjs returns GREEN for a valid DRAFT — a
// Draft is a legal spec state, and /pharn-spec must validate Drafts too — so `check-spec GREEN` ALONE
// is not the gate. This file adds the ONE assertion check-spec deliberately omits — `state ===
// "Approved"` — on TOP of check-spec's exact verification. It shells to check-spec.mjs as a CLI (NOT a
// sibling import, P3 — the same separation check-regress / check-verify use to re-run other floor
// gates), so the content-hash logic lives in exactly ONE place and can never drift between the two.
//
// THE SAME NOW HOLDS FOR `state`, AND IT DID NOT USED TO — the correction is worth stating, because the
// sentence above was true of the hash and FALSE of the state enum for as long as both were written here.
// This file carried a private `readState()`: FIRST-wins across duplicate keys, no comment strip, against
// check-spec's LAST-wins + comment-stripped parseSpec. Two checkers, one file, two answers — in BOTH
// directions. A frontmatter with `state: Approved` followed by `state: Draft` made validate read Draft
// while this GATE read Approved and returned exit 0 "Approved and un-drifted": a FAIL-OPEN, on the one
// gate whose entire job is to let only human-approved intent downstream. And a template-faithful
// `state: Approved # ratified 2026-08-18` made this gate RED a spec validate called GREEN. Both are now
// reproduced as tests. The state is read through `check-spec.mjs --state` — the same CLI shell-out, the
// same single-source discipline — and this file holds NO frontmatter parser of its own.
//
// Honestly bounded (P0), in the same terms check-spec.mjs's bodyHash already uses for the hash: that no
// THIRD parse of `state` is ever re-introduced is DISCIPLINE, not a floor op. The tests DETECT a divergent
// re-implementation (one asserts this source contains no frontmatter-parse construct at all); they do not
// PREVENT one. That bound is written here rather than upgraded into a claim the floor cannot back — the
// previous bound on this very defect was also prose, was also correct when written, and is what rotted.
//
// NON-LLM. Node stdlib only (child_process to invoke the sibling CLI; no network, no eval, no deps).
//
// Honest scope (P0): it guarantees a SPEC is Approved + un-drifted + well-shaped — the deterministic
// PRECONDITION of planning. It does NOT — cannot — judge whether the resulting PLAN is correct, or the
// intent wise. "passed check-spec-approved" means ONLY "the input spec is approved and unchanged",
// NEVER "the plan will be good" — that conflation is the P0 disease this repo exists to prevent. And
// note the two clocks: this checker's VERDICT is floor; /pharn-plan's ACT of invoking it and obeying
// the exit code is ADVISORY command orchestration (exactly as /pharn-dev-ship reads a sub-stage verdict).
//
// Trust (P2): the SPEC body is untrusted human intent (DATA). The verdict ranges ONLY over the
// enum-gated / floor-verifiable fields (the `state` enum + check-spec's section-presence + body-hash
// equality) — NEVER over the intent's meaning. No guaranteed decision rests on the free-text intent
// (mirrors fix #1; the ★ test proves an instruction-looking needle in the intent does not move it).
//
// Usage:
//   node pharn/floor/check-spec-approved.mjs <SPEC.md>   exit 0 iff Approved + un-drifted + well-shaped
//                                                        (GREEN); exit 1 otherwise (Draft / drift /
//                                                        malformed / unreadable), printing a clear RED.
//
// Exit: 0 only for an Approved, un-drifted, well-shaped SPEC; 1 on every refusal (fail-closed).
